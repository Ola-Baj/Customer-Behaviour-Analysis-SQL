# Customer-Behaviour-Analysis-SQL

This project's primary objective is to explore customer spending patterns, trends, and the factors that impact them. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover valuable insights into customer preferences, purchasing behaviors, and identify potential areas for enhancement in menu offerings and marketing strategies within a dining establishment.


### Background

Danny's profound passion for Japanese cuisine drove him to take a bold step at the start of 2021 â€“ he launched a charming little eatery specializing in his top three favorite dishes: sushi, curry, and ramen. However, Danny's Diner now faces the challenge of staying successful, as they've collected some fundamental operational data during their initial months but lack the expertise to leverage this data for the betterment of their business.


### Problem Statement

Danny is eager to harness the power of data to uncover essential insights about his customers. He's particularly interested in understanding their visitation patterns, expenditure patterns, and their favorite menu items. By establishing a deeper connection with his clientele, he aims to enhance their dining experience with a more personalized touch.

These insights will play a pivotal role in determining the potential expansion of his existing customer loyalty program. Furthermore, Danny requires assistance in creating user-friendly datasets that can be easily analyzed by his team, eliminating the need for SQL expertise.

For privacy reasons, Danny has provided a subset of his customer data as examples, with the hope that these samples will enable you to craft fully functional SQL queries to address his inquiries effectively.

### Skills Applied

- Window Functions
- CTEs
- Aggregations
- JOINs
- Write scripts to generate basic reports that can be run every period


### Questions Explored

1. What is the cumulative spending of each customer at the restaurant?
2. How many times has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the initial menu item purchased by each customer?
4. Which menu item was purchased the most frequently, and how many times did all customers buy it?
5. Which menu item was the favorite for each individual customer?
6. What was the first menu item purchased by each customer after they joined the loyalty program?
7. What menu item was bought just before a customer became a member of the loyalty program?
8. What are the total number of items purchased and the total spending for each customer before they became program members?
9. If every $1 spent earns 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier, how many points does each customer have?
10. During the first week after joining the loyalty program (including their join date), customers earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi. How many points do Customer A and Customer B have at the end of January?


### Insights

- Customer B holds the record for the highest frequency of visits in January 2021, with a total of 6 visits.
- At Danny's Diner, the top-selling item is ramen, followed by curry and sushi.
- Customer A has a strong preference for ramen, while Customer C exclusively enjoys ramen. On the other hand, Customer B appears to have an equal affinity for sushi, curry, and ramen.
- Interestingly, both Customer A and Customer B ordered sushi and curry as their last items before becoming members. This raises the question of whether these two menu items played a pivotal role in their decision to join the loyalty program
